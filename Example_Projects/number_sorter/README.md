# Number Sorter

This project is a simple number sorting program written in Rust. The program generates 10 random integers, sorts them using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm, and prints both the unsorted and sorted numbers. The maximum value for the random numbers is provided by the user at runtime.

## Features
- Generates 10 random integers.
- User-defined maximum value for the random number range.
- Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the generated numbers.
- Prints the unsorted numbers, followed by the sorted numbers.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to input the maximum value for the random numbers.
2. The program generates 10 random integers within the specified range.
3. The numbers are printed out.
4. The numbers are sorted using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.
5. Finally, the sorted list of numbers is printed out.

## Requirements
- **Rust**: You must have Rust installed to run this project. You can download and install Rust from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PaulGerdes/Rust_Learn_Progress/tree/master/Example_Projects/number_sorter.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd number-sorter
    ```

3. Build and run the program:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to input the maximum value for the random numbers.
